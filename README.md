## Dataset

We will use the **Fake and Real News Dataset** (link) and **WelFake Dataset** (link) from Kaggle, along with additional curated sources from open repositories. These datasets provide balanced samples of true and false news articles for training and evaluation.

## Project Idea

The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms poses serious risks to society. Our project aims to develop a machine learning system that classifies news articles as "fake" or "real." We will apply natural language processing (NLP) methods such as tokenization, TF-IDF, and word embeddings, and compare traditional models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes) against deep learning approaches (Transformer-based models). The goal is to identify the most accurate and generalizable solution for automated fake news detection.

## Planned Steps

1. Collect and preprocess data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
2. Extract features using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT.
3. Train baseline models (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest).
4. Implement advanced models (Transformer).
5. Evaluate using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6. Perform error analysis to refine methods.
7. (Optional) Deploy a prototype user interface.
